# my Dotfiles

Hi there, these are my configurations for my devices, sorted in desktop and laptop
systems. Feel free to use these as you like

### Installation

I recommend to use your .config directory in your home directory to be this
repository as a fork, so that you can store what you need.

To do this, fork this Repository and then initialize a git repository in your .config
directory. Then set the url for this local Repository as the one from your fork

If you have files like `.zshrc` which need to be open in the home directory,
you can link this file into your home directory by using
`ln -s ~/.config/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc`. This utilization
of symlinks enables you to be much more efficient in syncing your configuration
to github, instead of copying the file once in a while.

#### Have fun customizing your own setup!
