# My Dotfiles

Hi there, these are my configurations for my devices, sorted in desktop and laptop
systems. Feel free to use these as you like

### Installation

I recommend to use your .config directory in your home directory to be this
repository as a fork, so that you can store what you need.

To do this, fork this Repository and then initialize a git repository in your .config
directory. Then set the url for this local Repository as the one from your fork

```sh
cd .config
git init
git remote add origin [your fork]
git pull
```
Now all that's left to do is execute `init.sh`, which links some configurations
in the right place, making backups if necessary.

#### Have fun customizing your own setup!
